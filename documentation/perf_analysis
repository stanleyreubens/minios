# Performance Analysis

## Time Complexity Analysis

### Process Management
```
Process Creation: O(1)
Process Termination: O(1)
Process Scheduling: O(n log n)
Process Lookup: O(1)
```

### Resource Management
```
Resource Allocation: O(1)
Resource Release: O(1)
Deadlock Detection: O(V + E)
  V = number of processes
  E = number of resources
```

### Thread Pool
```
Task Enqueue: O(1)
Task Dequeue: O(1)
Thread Creation: O(1)
```

## Space Complexity

### Static Memory Usage
```
Process Table: O(n)
Resource Table: O(m)
Thread Pool: O(t)
  n = processes
  m = resources
  t = threads
```

### Dynamic Memory
```
Per Process: 64 bytes base + resources
Per Resource: 16 bytes
Per Thread: 8MB stack + overhead
```

## Performance Bottlenecks

### Critical Sections
1. Resource Allocation
   - Mutex contention
   - Lock wait times

2. Process Scheduling
